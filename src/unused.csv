6;2;6;managing a project is about identifying requirements
17;2;9;Project managers expect change and implement processes to keep change managed and controlled.
18;2;9;Project managers manage the project team to meet the project objectives.
29;2;18;Generally, a project life cycle is contained within one or more product Iife cycles
34;2;20;Each phase is formally initiated to specify what is allowed and expected for that phase
41;2;27;normal work hours are important to known
46;2;39;There are 5 project management process groups: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and control, and closing. (we will now focus on the project planning group)
47;2;43;the project planning group collects requirements and defines the scope
48;2;43;the project planning group defines activities, their sequence, their estimated resources, their estimated durations, and the develop schedule
49;2;43;the project planning group estimates the costs and budget
50;2;43;the project planning group plans the quality
51;2;43;the project planning group plans the communication
52;2;43;the project planning group plans the risk management, identifies them, performance qualitative and quantitative analysis, and plan responses to risks.
53;2;43;the project planning group plans the procurement
54;2;46;The Planning Process Group consists of those processes pertormed to establish the total scope of the effort, define and refine the objectives, and develop the course of action required to attain those objectives.
72;2;57;project managements generates change request, work performance information, project plan updates, and project documentation updates.
73;2;57;project management performes the quality audit, and the quality controle measurements.
74;2;57;poject management assignes staff, and arranges the resource calendars
75;2;58;project management develops the team competencies, interaction, and environment.
76;2;58;project management tracks team performance, provides feedback, solves issues, and optimizes project performance.
77;2;58;project management distrubutes relevant information to the project stakeholders
78;2;59;project management communicates and works with stakeholders to meet their needs and adress their issues
79;2;59;project management is about issues log and the change log.
87;2;121;WBS contains control account which have identifiers, these are used for planning/resource references
89;2;130;Developing the project schedule uses the outp uts from the processes to define activities, sequence activities, estimate activity resources, and to estimate activity durations in combination with the scheduling tool to produce the schedule
91;2;131;output of the activity definition process is: a activity list, activity attributes, and a milestone list
92;2;131;the sequence of the activities in a project is determined using a defined approach.
96;2;131;The schedule is based on: Activity list, Activity attributes, Project schedule network diagrams, Activity resource requirements, Resource calendars, Activity duration estimates, Project scope statement, Enterprise environmental factors, and Organizational process assets
98;2;131;The schedule is controlled, which tries to constantly improve/adjust the schedule based on reality. It can generate change requests, and performance measurements
100;2;134;A standard activity list or a portion of an activity list from a previous project is often usable as a template for a new project
105;2;136;At the end of planning of a project the components of a activity may include: activity codes, activity description, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions.
107;2;136;Activity attributes are used during schedule development and reports generation
117;2;141;A project schedule network diagram can be produced manually or by using project management software
121;2;144;The history of previous projects can be used for planning new projects. (as in resource allocations etc)
122;2;145;Project management software has the capability to help plan, organize, and manage resource pools and develop resource estimates. Depending on the sophistication of the software, resource breakdown structures, resource availability, resource rates and various resource calendars can be defined to assist in optimizing resource utilization
125;2;146;Activity Durations uses the estimated work effort required to complete the activity and the estimated resources to be applied to complete the activity these are used to approximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity
129;2;152;The project schedule takes the following input: activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule constraints
131;2;152;Schedule development can cause review and revision of the estimates
138;2;161;The project schedule can be changed based on actual performance of previous tasks in the schedule
141;2;218;Human resource planning is used to determine and identify human resources with the necessary skills required for project success
143;2;219;Human resource planning uses activity resource requirements to determine the human resources needed for the project.
147;2;312;Risk monitoring can create change requests for either corrective or preventive actions.
148;2;334;Procurements can create change requests since the choice of a partner can have a impact on the solution strategy
